  "caseDescription": "Arsalan Ansari, a 21-year-old student of Guru Ghasidas University, Bilaspur, was reported missing from 21 October 2025. According to his family, the university authorities did not provide timely information regarding his disappearance. On 24 October 2025, the family was informed about his death. Media reports state that his body was later recovered from a pond located within or near the university campus. Initially, the incident was described as a case of suicide; however, the family has raised serious concerns due to visible injury marks found on the body, which they believe are inconsistent with suicide. News reports have also highlighted alleged lapses in communication, handling of the situation, and delays in the investigation. Arsalan Ansari’s father has formally demanded a free, fair, transparent, and time-bound investigation so that the truth may come to light and justice may be ensured.",
